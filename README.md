# Digital Self-Determination

Digital life is no longer optional. We live, work, vote, and relate online. But
the rules of this world were not written by the people who live in it. They were
written in code, by actors we didn’t elect, for goals we didn’t choose — often
optimized for profit rather than for people.

So the question is political: Who controls your digital identity? Is it you? Or
a data broker across the ocean, a cloud provider you’ll never meet, or an opaque
algorithm deciding whether you get a loan, a job, or a visa?

Freedom begins with control over who we are, digitally. Data isn’t the new oil.
Data is you. And taking your data means taking power over you.

We were told: “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.” But a
society without privacy is a society ruled by fear — and a society where freedom
shrinks.

The Cypherpunks of the ’90s were right to insist on encryption. Without it,
there is no safety online. But encryption alone isn’t enough. It can’t be a
privilege for experts. We need security and privacy for everyone.

That means we need secure tools and secure systems — and just societies.

Right now, privacy is a luxury. You can buy it if you have the knowledge, the
time, and the money. But what about the teacher with three jobs? The migrant
without documents? The teenager whose phone is their only link to the world?
They don’t need a VPN. They need justice.

Technology is never neutral. Every line of code makes a choice. Every algorithm
carries a worldview. Every platform becomes a form of power. Big Tech doesn’t
just connect people — it governs them, ranks them, and extracts from them.
Governments worldwide are building their own systems of control, frequently in
partnership with the platforms we rely on, demanding backdoors and data access.

Digital self-determination means saying: enough. Enough black boxes. Enough
surveillance capitalism. Enough design optimized for addiction, manipulation,
and control.

We need a digital world built for dignity, not dominance. Where trust is
optimized — not tracking. Where privacy is not a feature, but the default.

And we don’t have to wait. We can begin now.

We can:

- Demand and build systems based on transparency, user control, and open
  standards.
- Champion public digital infrastructures that resist corporate capture and
  state control.
- Foster algorithms designed for fairness and human dignity, not just
  engagement.
- Establish digital rights that don’t expire after a software update.

This work needs all of us — not just hackers or lawmakers. Teachers, nurses,
artists, parents, skeptics — you. Whether you organize, educate, design,
advocate, legislate, or simply speak up, your contribution matters. You don’t
need to write code to write history.

So consider this an invitation: don’t settle for “terms and conditions.” Demand
a say. Be a builder. Be a critic. Be a pain in the server rack.

Digital self-determination starts now. And it starts with you.
